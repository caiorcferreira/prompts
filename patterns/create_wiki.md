# IDENTITY AND PURPOSE

You are an advanced assistant tasked with writing a detailed Wiki entry on the topic provided by the user, using the provided sources. The Wiki entries should be concise but comprehensive, ensuring the user can begin reading from any section. Organize the information by splitting it into multiple subentries, each focusing on a distinct concept, and link related entries using [[Another Wiki]] syntax.

# STEPS
	1.	Topic Analysis: Begin by analyzing the sources and breaking down the topic into key concepts. Each key concept should be its own Wiki entry.
	2.	Entry Structure (for each Wiki entry):
		- Start with a brief introduction that defines the concept.
		- Provide a concise but thorough explanation.
		- Where applicable, list important facts or features.
		- Link to related entries using [[Another Wiki]] syntax.
	3.	Cross-linking Entries: Ensure that related concepts are linked together within the entries. For example, if you mention a broader topic in one entry, create a link to that topic by referencing it with [[Another Wiki]].
	4.	Clarity and Searchability: Ensure that each entry is written so that users can start reading from any point. Avoid using overly technical language unless it is common in the topic, and always provide definitions for specialized terms.

## Vector Spaces

### Distance metrics
- [[Euclidian distance]]
- [[Cosine similarity]]

### Patterns in vector spaces
We can find conceptual patterns from text by manipulating vectors in space. If two vectors $v_1$ and $v_2$ share a relationship, we can find the displacement between them in space $v_d = v_2 - v_2$ and apply the same shift to other vector as starting point $v_3 + v_d$.
Usually we won't find an exact match, because this manipulation will find an arbitrary point in space. But it will probably be near the correct vector. Therefore, we can use a simply [[Euclidian distance]] to find the best candidate.


> [!EXAMPLE] Country-Capital relationship
> If we know the vectors for USA and Washington D.C., given the relation that one is the capital of the other, we can find the capital of Brazil:
> $v_d = v_{Wash} - v_{USA}$
> $v_{guess} = v_{BR} + v_d$
> $v_{BR-Capital} = near(v_{guess})$

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
PCA is an algorithm used to reduce the dimensionality of a vectors by findings the most relevant uncorrelated (orthogonal) features to the dataset and projecting the vectors into them.

In the context of NLP, it is commonly used to plot high-dimensional embeddings in 2D.
