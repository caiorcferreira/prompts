# Task: Create a Comprehensive Markdown Todo Checklist

## Objective
Develop a `todo.md` file that serves as a thorough, structured checklist of the project tasks.

## Requirements

1. **Checklist Format**
   - Format tasks using markdown checkboxes (e.g., `- [ ] Task description`).
   - Include sub-tasks under main tasks using nested checkboxes if needed.

2. **Task Details**
   - Ensure each task is actionable and clear.
   - Optionally include priority markers (e.g., High, Medium, Low) or due dates next to tasks.
   - Allow space for brief notes or additional details for each task.

## Output Format
- The final output should be a markdown file named `todo.md`.
- The content should be fully formatted with sections, checkboxes, and examples so that itâ€™s immediately ready for use.
